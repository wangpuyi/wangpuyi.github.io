<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I'm a third year undergraduate student from School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Hengshuang Zhao](https://www.XXX.com/) from HKU. I was advised by [Prof. Guangtao Zhai](https://faculty.sjtu.edu.cn/zhaiguangtao/zh_CN/index.htm) from SJTU.

My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphics, machine learning, and computational photography.
